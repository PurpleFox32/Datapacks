# Datapacks

This Repo Contains most of my work as a datapack Developer. Feel Free to download any or all of these.

Also...

Even though this is an open source Repo, please do not make any changes to the packs without my authorization. As long as you know what you are doing AND you contact me prior to making any changes (please be very specific with what you plan on doing), I will allow changes from others.

**Please Note**

These Datapacks are for Java Edition ONLY!

All of these Datapacks work and are easily updated.

If any of them are outdated, please let me know and I will update them to whatever version is specified.

I will mark each datapack with the version they work on.

**Also Note**

The versions listed that say 1.19-1.19.3 will NOT work on 1.19.4. Same with the other way around.

Please contact me if you would like to request un update or downgrade. I cannot go any lower than 1.13-1.14.4 and cannot go any higher than the latest version/snapshot.
